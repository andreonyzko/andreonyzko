Hi, my name is Andr√©, I'm 20 years old and I'm a Software Engineering student at UTFPR. I'm currently participating in the UOL Compass Scholarship training program.

I usually say that video games, when I was still a child, captivated my passion for technology and opened the doors to the world of programming. As a teenager, I developed my first Discord bot through visual programming, which encouraged me to take my first web development course. From that moment on, I thought to myself: "This is what I want for my life!" So I enrolled at the Instituto Federal do Parana, where I completed technical high school in informatic.

In addition to my academic studies, I continue to constantly seek out new sources of knowledge, exploring courses and other ways of learning outside the classroom.
